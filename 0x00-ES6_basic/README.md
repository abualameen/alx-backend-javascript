# 0x00. ES6 Basics

This repository covers the basics of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), the sixth edition of the JavaScript language specification. Below are the objectives covered in this module:

## Objectives

1. **What ES6 is:**
   ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the JavaScript language standard. It introduces significant enhancements and new features to make JavaScript programming more efficient and powerful.

2. **New features introduced in ES6:**
   ES6 introduces numerous new features, including arrow functions, template literals, const and let for variable declaration, class syntax for object-oriented programming, destructuring assignment, default parameters, rest and spread operators, and much more.

3. **The difference between a constant and a variable:**
   In ES6, `const` is used to declare constants, whose value cannot be reassigned once initialized. On the other hand, `let` is used to declare variables that can be reassigned within their scope.

4. **Block-scoped variables:**
   Variables declared with `const` and `let` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined in (commonly denoted by curly braces `{}`). This is in contrast to `var`, which has function scope.

5. **Arrow functions and function parameters default to them:**
   Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They have implicit returns and lexical `this` binding. They are commonly used for callbacks and short anonymous functions.

6. **Rest and spread function parameters:**
   Rest parameters (`...`) allow functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. Spread syntax (`...`) allows an iterable to be expanded into multiple arguments or elements.

7. **String templating in ES6:**
   Template literals, denoted by backticks (\`\`), allow embedding expressions within strings using `${}` syntax. They provide a more readable and concise way to create strings with variables and multiline strings.

8. **Object creation and their properties in ES6:**
   ES6 introduces shorthand syntax for creating objects and defining object properties. It also introduces computed property names, method definitions, and the ability to define getters and setters.

9. **Iterators and for-of loops:**
   Iterators are objects that provide a way to iterate over sequences of data. The `for-of` loop is a convenient syntax for iterating over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, and generators.

This module aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these ES6 features and their usage in modern JavaScript development.
