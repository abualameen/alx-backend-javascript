## Comprehensive Guide to JavaScript Data Manipulation

This README provides a comprehensive guide to using various JavaScript data manipulation techniques, including map, filter, and reduce on arrays, as well as an overview of typed arrays and data structures like Set, Map, and WeakLink.

### Using Map, Filter, and Reduce on Arrays

#### Map:
- The `map` method in JavaScript creates a new array by applying a provided function to each element of an existing array.
- It doesn't change the original array; instead, it returns a new array with the results of applying the provided function to each element.

#### Filter:
- The `filter` method in JavaScript creates a new array with elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- It doesn't modify the original array; instead, it returns a new array containing only the elements for which the provided function returns `true`.

#### Reduce:
- The `reduce` method in JavaScript executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
- It takes an accumulator and the current value as arguments and returns a single value.

### Typed Arrays

- Typed arrays in JavaScript are arrays where each element is of a fixed size and type, unlike regular JavaScript arrays, which can hold elements of different types.
- They are commonly used for handling binary data and working with low-level data manipulation.

### Set, Map, and WeakLink Data Structures

#### Set:
- `Set` is a collection of unique values, where each value may occur only once.
- It provides methods for adding, removing, and checking the presence of elements.

#### Map:
- `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key can map to only one value.
- It provides methods for adding, removing, and retrieving values based on keys.

#### WeakLink:
- `WeakLink` is a special type of link in JavaScript that allows objects to be held weakly, meaning they can be garbage collected if there are no other strong references to them.
- It's often used to prevent memory leaks in scenarios where objects are associated with DOM elements or long-lived data structures.

### How to Use
- Each section provides an overview of the concept and usage examples.
- You can refer to the code examples provided to understand how to use these techniques in your JavaScript projects.

### Testing and Verification
- Ensure your code is tested using Jest and verified against lint using ESLint.
- Run `npm run full-test` to verify the entire project.
