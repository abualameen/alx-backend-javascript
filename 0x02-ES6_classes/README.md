**JavaScript Class Basics**

This README provides a comprehensive guide to understanding JavaScript classes and related concepts, including methods, static methods, class extension, and metaprogramming with symbols.

### Defining a Class

A class in JavaScript serves as a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and behaviors. To define a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Inside the class definition, you can specify properties and methods.

### Adding Methods to a Class

Methods are functions that are associated with objects created from a class. They define the behavior of the objects. To add methods to a class, define functions inside the class definition. These methods can access properties of the class instance using the `this` keyword.

### Adding Static Methods to a Class

Static methods in JavaScript belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. They are called on the class itself, not on instances. Static methods are useful for utility functions or operations that don't require access to instance-specific data. To add a static method to a class, use the `static` keyword before the method name.

### Extending a Class from Another

Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class. To extend a class, use the `extends` keyword followed by the name of the class you want to extend. This allows the new class to inherit all properties and methods from the parent class while also adding its own unique properties and methods.

### Metaprogramming and Symbols

Metaprogramming refers to writing code that manipulates other code at runtime. Symbols are a primitive data type introduced in ES6. They are unique and immutable values often used as object property keys. Symbols are useful in metaprogramming scenarios where you want to define unique property keys or create custom behavior for objects.

**Conclusion**

Understanding JavaScript classes and related concepts is essential for building modular, maintainable, and scalable code. By mastering class definition, method addition, static methods, class extension, and metaprogramming with symbols, you can leverage the full power of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
